Kihamura
========

Kihamura is a video editor that have the following goals:
* be user-friendly;
* be stable;
* be comfortable to new users, that are used to easy video editors, like
Microsoft's Movie Maker;
* be _sufficient_ for experienced users;
* works out-of-the-box, with no special setup.

Its target are the non-technical users that needs a video editor that
just works.

## Requirements
For now, only automake and autoconf. Might depend of gtk in the future.

## Build O.Ss
All systems that satisfy the requirements above should run Kihamura once it
compiles, and so Windows with Windows Subsystem for Linux, although you'll need
to install a X server to it in the future.

## License
I didn't choose a license yet, but will probably be the GNU General Public License,
version 2.0.
